# Nitro Generator - Version Python, Batch, and Bash

This project includes three versions of the "Nitro Generator" tool:
- **Python Version**
- **Windows Executanle Version (.exe)**
- **Bash Version (for Linux and macOS)**

### Set Up

- Before running any version of the tool, follow these setup steps:

1. Create a folder on your desktop (or anywhere you prefer) named:

    ```text
    Nitro Gen
    ```
2. Move the script you want to use into this folder:
   - `generator.py` *(for Python users)*
   - `NitroGen.exe` *(for Windows executable users)*
   - `linux_generator.sh` *(for Linux/macOS users)*
3. Open a terminal (or simply double-click the `.exe` file if using Windows).
4. Follow the steps in the corresponding section below to run the tool:
   - [Python Version](#python-version)
   - [Windows Executable Version](#windows-executable-version-exe)
   - [Bash Version (for Linux and macOS)](#bash-version-for-linux-and-macos)

This setup ensures all generated files (`valid_nitro_codes.txt`) stay organized in one place.

## Python Version

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x (preferably 3.11)
- Install the required dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install random
    ```

### How to run:
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python3 generator.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen menu options to interact with the tool.

## Windows Executable Version (.exe)

### **Requirements:**
- A **Windows** operating system (no Python required)

### **How to run:**
1. Download the `NitroGen.exe` file from the repository.
2. **Double-click** to launch it. A command-line window will open.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Simulated **Node.js installation** and **package downloads** for fun.
   - Enter how many codes you want to generate.
   - The tool will create and test random **Discord Nitro gift codes**.

### **Notes:**
- The `.exe` is a **standalone version** of the Python script, compiled for easy use on Windows.
- ⚠️ **This is a troll/fake Nitro generator** — all codes are randomly generated and extremely unlikely to be valid.

## Bash Version (for Linux and macOS)

### Requirements:
- Linux or macOS operating system
- Bash shell

### How to run:
1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Ensure the `linux_generator.sh` script is executable. If not, run:

    ```bash
    chmod +x linux_generator.sh
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./linux_generator.sh
    ```

5. Follow the on-screen menu options to interact with the tool.

**Note:** This version works on Linux and macOS. It uses Bash for script execution.

## Features:
- **Generate Nitro Codes:** Simulates the generation of Nitro codes.
- **Save Valid Codes:** If a valid code is generated, it gets saved to a text file.
- **Troll Effect:** Simulates the process with random success/failure, making it appear as if valid codes are being generated.
